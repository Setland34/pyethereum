## Purpose of the Repository

This repository contains the implementation of the Ethereum blockchain protocol in Python. It includes the core components required to run an Ethereum node, such as block processing, transaction handling, and state management.

### Main Components

- `blocks.py`: Contains the `Block` class, which represents a block in the Ethereum blockchain.
- `transactions.py`: Contains the `Transaction` class, which represents a transaction in the Ethereum blockchain.
- `trie.py`: Contains the `Trie` class, which is used for state management in the Ethereum blockchain.
- `manager.py`: Contains functions for managing the blockchain, such as generating addresses and receiving objects.
- `processblock.py`: Contains functions for processing blocks and evaluating contracts.
- `parser.py`: Contains the `parse` function for parsing input data.
- `rlp.py`: Contains functions for encoding and decoding data using Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding.
- `trietest.py`: Contains the `trie_test` function for testing the `Trie` class.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum.git
   cd pyethereum
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the development environment is set up and activated.

2. Run the tests using `pytest`:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
